Hello everyone.

In this project I will be exploring Quebec Covid data regarding the events of the first and second lockdown, as well as the school re-opening in October 2021.

There are two notebooks. One where we explore different types of models using the second lockdown as a sample.

After this work we take the best method and fully analyze all 3 events.

Enjoy!
